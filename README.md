# femIndentationModel

This repository contains the MATLAB/ANSYS code to reproduce the results of 

*"Estimation of the in-situ elastic constants of wood pulp fibers in freely dried paper via AFM experiments"*

**C. Czibula, A. Brandberg, M. J. Cordill, A. MatkoviÄ‡, O. Glushko, Ch. Czibula, A. Kulachenko, C. Teichert, U. Hirn**, In prep., 2020.

Usage is straightforward: Models are generated by running **femIndentationModel_main.m**, generating the plots shown in the ESI in the order which they are presented. 

A sample model is available in the folder named **sampleModel**.

The code was tested and run on

    ANSYS 2020 R2

    MATLAB 2020a
